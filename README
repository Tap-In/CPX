This is a cloud-based 'internet of things' (IoT) controller for the 
Arduino using the Tap In Control Plan service. An intermediate level
of skill in working with the Arduino is assumed by this project.

With this system you can write programs on your local host that
directly controls the Arduino. Using this technique you can build
more sophisticated programs that would fit in the Arduino itself.

For example, you could build the hardware for a robot, then send the 
low level commands to the Arduino from an HTLM5 based application using
jquery. 

A cloud service is provided so your Arduino can connect to the Internet a
Wifi shield, or from an RS232 cable from your PC/Linux/Mac tethered to your
Arduino.

Libraries are provided in Ruby, C, Java and Javascript to interface with your
Arduino project.

Enjoy,

Tap In Systems
